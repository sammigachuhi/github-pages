title: Welcome to my blog

I know the political season is over and the least you want to hear about is anything to do with politics. If you are one who merely follows this topic, like me, then
            you know what I mean. Some of you may reminiscent me saying that I am taking a break to concentrate on other matters. However, a slight window of opportunity opened up,
            and before it shut, this article had already been penned down.  Anyway, the reason this article is going to print is to chronicle a conversation I held in August during
            the election tallying period but which has remained imprinted on my mind ever since. Good things are meant to be shared, no?
